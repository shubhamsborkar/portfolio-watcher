"""Longbridge (Hong Kong and Singapore), through its OpenAPI. Free for its
clients, and the way into Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland names that most
Western brokers do not reach. Three things from the developer page: an app key,
an app secret and an access token, which Longbridge issues for ninety days at a
time. Every request is signed on this computer with the secret, in the scheme
Longbridge publishes, so the secret itself never travels.

Reads /v1/asset/stock and /v1/asset/account. Positions carry the cost but not
the price, so the desk marks every line from Yahoo. Source:
open.longbridge.com/docs. Nothing here places a trade."""
