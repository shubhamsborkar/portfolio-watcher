"""The broker layer, taken from GreekSoup (github.com/shubhamsborkar/greeksoup, MIT).

The broker layer. One file per broker, all read-only, all the same shape.

The reader picks a broker on the Settings screen; the desk reads that broker's
account through the matching file here. Nothing in this folder places an order.

Every adapter module has:
  META                      id, label, where (plain words), fields (what the
                            reader pastes), daily_login (True when the broker's
                            regulator wants a fresh login every trading day),
                            region (the market file in markets/ that supplies
                            the session, the index and the currency), docs
  connect(cfg, token=None)  -> a client object, or raises BrokerError(plain words)
  label(client)             -> "A/C ··1234" (last four of the account, never a name)
  equity(client)            -> [row, ...]   see ROW below
  funds(client)             -> {"cash": float, "currency": "USD", "buying_power": float or None}
optional (README.md lists each one's shape; the desk shows what a file has):
  login_url, exchange_token           daily-login brokers
  futures, quote, history, intraday,  what the broker's feed serves beyond holdings
  futures_quote, sparks, tape, stream, stream_healthy
  resolve, search                     a symbol master, when broker codes differ from
                                      exchange symbols
  extra_accounts, commodities_local   several accounts; local commodity reads
  crypto                              crypto the account holds, for the Crypto block on
                                      Desk · Home (never the stock book): rows in the
                                      ROW shape, ysym the free feed's pair (BTC-USD)

ROW (one holding):
  code       the broker's own symbol         name    company name if the broker gives it
  exch       exchange, if known               qty     shares (float)
  avg        average cost per share           ltp     last price; None when the broker
                                                      does not give one (the desk fills
                                                      it from Yahoo through ysym)
  value, pnl, pnl_pct, day_pct               derived when possible, else None
  currency   "USD", "INR", "GBP" ...
  ysym       the Yahoo Finance symbol for the same share (AAPL, RELIANCE.NS, RR.L)

cfg is a dict of the adapter's fields read from the environment (.env).
